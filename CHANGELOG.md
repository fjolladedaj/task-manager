# Changelog

## Added
- Installed tailwindcss for styling purposes.
- Created custom styled components for consistent UI across the application.
- Created Welcome & Log In Views
- Created auth.js store to hold user data

## Fixed
- Bug fix 1: Discard changes successfully when editing.
- Bug fix 2: Subsequent edits to the copied task will not affect the original task.

## Other Changes
- Reinitialized package-lock.json for accuracy.
- Used eslint and prettier for code formatting.

## Notes
- TypeScript has not been used everywhere in the project due to time constraints and focusing efforts on other aspects.
- Approximately 5 hours were invested in the project. I dedicated time to creating custom components and substituting the existing ones with them, which ended up consuming more time than initially anticipated.
